What is different in this fork?
======================

This fork of the [OCUnit2JUnit script](https://github.com/ciryon/OCUnit2JUnit) allows to read output from [Kiwi BDD Testing Framework](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) and creates proper readable names for your CI environment. With the original version, all your specs would be called 'example', while this version uses your descriptions as method names.
